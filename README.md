# Price-Predictor-Deep-Learning
Developed both single-step and multi-step models utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for accurate stock price movement predictions, effectively harnessing long-term data patterns in time series data. Executed data pre-processing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning, enhancing the performance of the models in predicting stock price movements by 20%. 
The code performs time series prediction for stock prices using a LSTM neural network.
Here, the LSTM model is defined with two LSTM layers and two dense layers and it is compiled with an optimizer and loss function before then being trained on the training data. The trained model is then used to predict future stock prices using the testing data. 

We can see (in the image attached) that the code accurately predicts the low and high swings of the stock's price.
